# 🎮 Git Game Quest

## Welcome, Adventurer!

Welcome to the legendary **Git Game Quest**, a hidden journey where only the cleverest players reach the ultimate prize.
In this game, your wits, curiosity, and Git skills are your power-ups.
Each branch hides a challenge, each commit marks your progress, and only the best reach the final reward — the **Pull Shark badge** 🦈.

## Your Mission

Your quest is simple… but not easy:

* Navigate through branches like game levels.
* Solve the riddles and complete tasks in each step.
* Find the final branch and claim your reward.

Along the way, you’ll practice real Git skills: branching, committing, pushing, and merging.

## Instruction

**Clone the repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

Would you like me to make the tone sound **more like a coding challenge** and less fantasy-like (e.g. “levels,” “objectives,” “achievements”)?
